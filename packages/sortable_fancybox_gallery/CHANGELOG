1.17 - Prevent javascript conflicts in Concrete5.6+ when more than one addon/theme uses the fancybox effect (e.g. Slate Theme, Deluxe Image Gallery, Simple Image Gallery); File Manager no longer offers the useless option to "choose" images when you go there from the block edit dialog.
1.16 - Fixed "class BlockRecord not found" error in Concrete5.6
1.15 - Fixed Concrete5.5.0 bug when selecting default empty item from fileset dropdown
1.14 - Fixed "Divide By Zero" errors in Concrete 5.4.2 (thumbnail width/height controls were always disabled in the edit form)
1.13 - Removed duplicate "border" attribute from image output
1.12 - Fixed bug with unicode characters not being displayed properly in titles
1.11 - When more than one gallery block is on a page, clicking "prev/next" links on zoomed-out images now only flips between images in the same gallery. Also fixed a problem when other lightbox effects on a page would overlap with fancybox effect.
1.1 - Fixed bug where images were not displayed in grid when block is first added to page; added default sorting based on fileset display order when using Concrete 5.4.1.
1.0 - Initial Release
